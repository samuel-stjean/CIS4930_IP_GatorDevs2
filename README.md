## Game Interface

The game has 3 main areas:

**Your Land (Top Left)** - Plots represent land that can be empty, farms, or pens. - Click "Buy Plot" (cost: 200 coins) to expand your land. - Convert empty plots into:
• Farms to grow crops
• Pens to raise critters

**Shop (Top Right)** - Browse seeds and eggs. - Buy items using coins to grow crops or hatch critters.

**Inventory (Bottom)** - View the items you’ve collected (e.g., crops, critter drops). - Click on a sellable item to open the sell menu. - You can Sell 1 or Sell All to earn coins.

## Farming

- Convert a plot to a Farm.
- Use seeds from the shop (e.g., Lettuce Seed).
- Click an empty farm spot to plant.
- Wait for it to grow, then click to harvest.
- Harvested crops appear in your inventory.

## Critter Pens

- Convert a plot to a Pen.
- Buy eggs from the shop.
- Click the "Add Critter" button to hatch a critter.
- Critters produce resources over time (e.g., Slime Goo).
- Click the resource icon to collect it.

## Feeding & Watering

Critter Keeper now includes a more interactive care system using resources:
Food (for critters) and Water (for crops). You’ll find these in the Resources Bar on your game screen.

**How It Works:**

1. Selecting a Resource

   - Click on a Food or Water icon in the Resources Bar.
   - Your mouse cursor will change to display the selected resource.
   - This indicates you’re ready to apply that resource.

2. Applying the Resource

   - Click on a critter to feed it if you’ve selected Food.
     • This starts the critter’s production timer.
     • After a short wait, the critter will drop a resource (like Slime Goo).
   - Click on a growing crop to water it if you’ve selected Water.
     • Watering starts the timer for that crop’s current growth stage.
     • When time is up, the crop advances to the next stage.
     • Continue watering until it reaches full growth and can be harvested.

3. Cancelling a Selection
   - If you click anywhere else on the screen (not a valid target), your selection will be cleared.
   - You must re-click the resource in the bar to apply it again.

## Earning & Spending Coins

- Sell crops or critter drops from your inventory to earn coins.
- Use coins to:
  • Buy more seeds
  • Hatch critters
  • Expand and buy plots

(Note: A demo button at the bottom-left grants 50 coins when clicked.)

## Saving Progress

- All your game progress (inventory, coins, land state) is saved automatically.
- Your data is tied to your account and loaded every time you log in.

## Logging Out

- Click the Logout button at the top-left to safely exit the game.
- Your current state will be saved before logging out.
